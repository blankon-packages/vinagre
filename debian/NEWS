vinagre (2.23.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Since 2.23.4, Vinagre follows the XDG Base Directory Specification,
    which means it will use ~/.local/share/vinagre to store bookmarks,
    instead of ~/.gnome2/vinagre.bookmarks. The migration will happen
    automatically if there's no ~/.local/share/vinagre file yet.
